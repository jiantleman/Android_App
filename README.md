## 1. Introduction <a name="intro"></a>
This application is created as part of the [Build Your First Android App (Project-Centered Course)](https://www.coursera.org/learn/android-app) offered by CentraleSup√©lec through Coursera. Through the course, I learnt how to design and build an Android application with basic elements and functionalities using the Android Studio IDE.

While the course only equipped me with basic app development skills, I still wanted to build an app that would have a practical and meaningful application. I had earlier taken a public health course, [COVID-19 Contact Tracing](https://www.coursera.org/learn/covid-19-contact-tracing), taught by Johns Hopkins University, where I learnt about the basics of COVID-19 and the process of contact tracing. As a part of contact tracing, the public health authorities have to regularly check-in with cases and their contacts during the period of their isolation and quarantine. This gave me the idea to create an app to allow cases and contacts to update their health details, get information on the disease and quickly get help, thereby reducing the manpower needed to monitor and support them.

In this project, I also integrated my knowledge of databases and SQL obtained from IBM's [Databases and SQL for Data Science](https://www.coursera.org/learn/sql-data-science) course. I used an SQLite database to store and persist the health data on the device locally.

## 2. Application Layout <a name="app"></a>
### 2.1 Main Activity <a name="main"></a>
This is the main activity of the application, with four buttons that launch a different activity each.

</p>

### 2.2 Update Health Information Activity <a name="newHealth"></a>
This is the activity where users can update their health information. They can select the date and time using a picker. If they select the "I feel unwell" option, a series of checkboxes with the common signs and symptoms of COVID-19 appear.
<p align="center"><table><tr>
<td><img src="https://github.com/jiantleman/Android_App/blob/master/media/newHealth.png?raw=true" width="250" /> 
<td><img src="https://github.com/jiantleman/Android_App/blob/master/media/newHealth_selectTime.png?raw=true" width="250" /> 
<td><img src="https://github.com/jiantleman/Android_App/blob/master/media/newHealth_selectSigns.png?raw=true" width="250" />
</tr></table></p>

### 2.3 View Health Records Activity <a name="oldHealth"></a>
This is the activity where users can view their submitted records. Clicking the "Clear all data" button deletes all records from the database. When users subsequently click the "View Health Records" button from the main page, the see a message indicating that there is no existing records.
<p align="center"><table><tr>
<td><img src="https://github.com/jiantleman/Android_App/blob/master/media/oldHealth.png?raw=true" width="250" /> 
<td><img src="https://github.com/jiantleman/Android_App/blob/master/media/oldHealth_delete.png?raw=true" width="250" />
</tr></table></p>

### 2.4 Resources and Information Activity <a name="resources"></a>
This activity provides a drop down list of various resources that the user can view. When a resource is selected, a webpage is displayed with the useful information.
<p align="center"><table><tr>
<td><img src="https://github.com/jiantleman/Android_App/blob/master/media/resources.png?raw=true" width="250" /> 
<td><img src="https://github.com/jiantleman/Android_App/blob/master/media/resources_select.png?raw=true" width="250" />
</tr></table></p>

### 2.5 Get Help Activity <a name="help"></a>
This activity provides a list of useful numbers that the user can call. Clicking on the number launches the call application with the number entered.
<p align="center"><table><tr>
<td><img src="https://github.com/jiantleman/Android_App/blob/master/media/help.png?raw=true" width="250" /> 
<td><img src="https://github.com/jiantleman/Android_App/blob/master/media/help_dial.png?raw=true" width="250" />
</tr></table></p>

## 3. Demonstration <a name="demo"></a>

## 4. Discussion <a name="disc"></a>
This application is not intended to fully functional, but more of a proof-of-concept to demonstrate how a mobile application can assist in contact tracing efforts. Other further extensions that can explored to make this application more functional include:

 * The use of a cloud-based SQL database instead of a local database, such that the public health authorities would be able to retrieve the information submitted by the cases and contacts. 
 * Functionality to allow the public health authorities to send reminders to users to update their health information periodically.
 * Secure authentication procedure and encryption of health information to ensure privacy and confidentiality.
